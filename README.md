### Polymorphism

In the context of programming, Polymorphism refers to the ability of a piece of code to behave differently depending on the context in which it is used. There are several forms of polymorphism:

    - **ad hoc polymorphism**, which refers to function overloading.
    - **parametric polymorphism** in the form of templates.
    - **subtype polymorphism**, which allows a derived-class object to be used where a base-class object is expeted.

> The unqualified term "polymorphism" usually refers to subtype polymorphism.
